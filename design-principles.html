<p>This website is a great example of the rule of thirds. It uses 3 sections for 
    their shop on their home page in order to provide easy access and yet it still does not look cluttered. If you scroll down
    more they divide their page up into two section which allows focus points on those paticular items putting them right in the grid.

    <p>Apple is an obvious canidate for one of the better looking websites and I personally believe that it is an expectation considering half 45 percent of smartphone users have 
        an Iphone. They chose to display one thing at a time. First their app store, then Phones, Ipads, Headphones, etc. which keeps a clean design and one paticular focus as you 
    scroll. This has a disadvantage when it comes to accessability but they make up for it with a menu bar to get you right what you need.  </p>

    <p>I love the use of Fitt's Law on wix. they have a button "Get Started" exactly where your thumb or finger is resting while waiting for the page to load.
        This makes it very quick and easy to get going and build a website with them. </p></main>
